# My Software Design Patterns Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document and share my learning journey through various **Software Design Patterns**. As part of my software engineering studies and personal projects, I've explored and implemented several design patterns to enhance my understanding and skills in software architecture and problem-solving.

## Introduction

Software design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. Throughout this repository, I share my experiments, exercises, and implementations of these patterns, which include practical examples in **Java** and **Python**. By studying these patterns, I aim to improve my ability to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Design Patterns Explored

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help promote flexibility in object creation and minimize the dependency between classes.

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Allows the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern**: Allows constructing complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype.

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and how objects and classes are structured to form larger structures. These patterns help to simplify relationships between classes and objects.

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrappe
